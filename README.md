# Halifax Science Library - MySQL, MongoDB, PHP Application
Technology Used: MySQL, MongoDB, Python, Bash scripts, PHP, HTML5, CSS3

The project focussed on updating the existing database of Halifax Science Library which had the following immediate plans:
- Sell library items and record information about these sales(transactions)
- Record data about all articles in a magazine
- Record data about monthly expenses

Developed an EER diagram to understand the requirements, entities and the relationships between them. All entities and relationships were normalized to 3NF. 

Performed ETL tasks such as cleaning the raw JSON data and importing into MongoDB collections using bash scripts and python which was further processed to load data into newly created MySQL tables. 

Developed a functional PHP web application using HTML5 and CSS3 to streamline various employee operations such as:
- View data
- Add new articles
- Add new transactions
- Add new customers
- Cancel transactions
